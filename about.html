        <center><p style="font-size:20px; padding:100px;">With technologies like blockchain introduced to the the present world, many unthinkable dreams could be made possible into reality now. Defense is an important aspect of a state as it secures the perimeters and makes the people in the region living feel safe and secure. The concept of Internet of Battlefield Things(IoBT) has been introduced to make the battlefield scenarios more smart and intelligent. Blockchain can be used to connect the resources on the battlefield to make them work efficiently and in group. As blockchain follows decentralized consensus protocol, no one entity controls the context. Entities with less resources can combine together to achieve the objective under certain circumstances. Sharding approach can be implemented on such situations to overcome the shortcoming and make better use of the resources available. However, there are limitations on the resources available to implement such ideas on large scale. Intensive work in the field is necessary to make a breakthrough and make interconnected intelligent battle fighting machines.</p></center>
